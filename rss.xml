These are designed to help researchers develop the programming, automation and data management skills needed to support their research.  &lt;strong&gt;Workshop dates are to be announced shortly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry logos" src="http://rse.shef.ac.uk/images/sc-dc-logos.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Addressing the training needs of researchers with regards to programming&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more researchers realise they can produce better quality research more quickly if
they have some coding and data management skills under their belts
universities will need to ensure that training in these areas is accessible to those that need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Academic institutions will most likely already have courses for teaching highly-specialist subjects
(such as how to use the local &lt;a href="http://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/"&gt;HPC cluster&lt;/a&gt;)
but for the more generic aspects of research software development and data management
there are several obvious choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop and deliver bespoke materials;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy in to commercial training packages;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Point researchers towards free online resources;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is also a fourth option:
team up with the &lt;a href="https://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; (SC) and
&lt;a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/"&gt;Data Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; (DC) not-for-profit organisations
to deliver on-site, interative workshops based on open-source materials that have been
refined by a large community of SC and DC instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Software whatywhaty?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/strong&gt; has developed &lt;a href="https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/"&gt;discipline-agnostic workshop material&lt;/a&gt; on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;programming with Python, R or MATLAB;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using databases and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL"&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell"&gt;UNIX shell&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control"&gt;version control&lt;/a&gt; with git or mercurial;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;automation using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)"&gt;Make&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.datacarpentry.org/lessons/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Carpentry&lt;/strong&gt; lessons&lt;/a&gt; look at data management and processing within the context of a specific domain (such as ecology or genomics), focussing on areas such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the command line;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data cleaning and filtering using &lt;a href="http://openrefine.org/"&gt;OpenRefine&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;data processing and visualisation with Python or R;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cloud computing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system"&gt;GIS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What form do the workshops take?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Software and Data Carpentry organisations ask that accredited instructors delivering 'branded' workshops adopt a fairly progressive teaching style:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workshops typically last two days and include four lessons (e.g. the unix shell, Python, version control and databases).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's lots of &lt;em&gt;live coding&lt;/em&gt;: the instructor and students gather together in a room with laptops and a projector and all present go through a number of examples interactively.  Students use their own laptops to ensure that they're able to continue where they left off at the end of a workshop.  Instructors can and do make mistakes when doing live coding; students can then learn from these mistakes and may grow in confidence on learning that pros make mistakes too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instructors try to elicit responses from students and use quizes to gauge comprehension and keep students focussed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Carpentry has a &lt;a href="https://software-carpentry.org/conduct/"&gt;code of conduct&lt;/a&gt; and tries to ensure that all lessons delivered under its banner are as &lt;a href="https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2017/02/inclusion.html"&gt;inclusive as possible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What's happening at the University?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University is now a Software Carpentry Partner Organisation so can run many workshops per year using the Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry branding.  We could run workshops without the branding but Software and Data Carpentry are now familiar names to researchers (and potentially employers) and by working closely with those two organisations we become part of a global network of instructors with which we can share ideas and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSE team and Library collectively now have five accredited Software and Data Carpentry instructors: Mike Croucher received training some time ago and in March Tania Allard and I from the &lt;a href="http://rse.shef.ac.uk/contact/"&gt;RSE team&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/library/libstaff/researchservices"&gt;Jez Cope and Beth Hellen&lt;/a&gt; from the Library's Research Services Unit participated in &lt;a href="https://steve-crouch.github.io/2017-03-16-oxford-ttt/"&gt;instructor training in Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Software Carpentry Instructor Training session" src="http://rse.shef.ac.uk/images/soft-carp-instructor-training.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four of us spent two days learning about the SC/DC teaching style, what makes for an effective instructor and got to practise several aspects of workshop development and delivery.  I must thank the instructors on the training course (Mateuz Kuzak and Steve Crouch) plus &lt;a href="https://rroxford.github.io/"&gt;Reproducible Research Oxford&lt;/a&gt; for hosting and organising the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are now planning our first Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry workshops.  These are to be held later in the summer.  &lt;/p&gt;

The event provided a great opportunity to hear from researchers all around the University about the software engineering challenges faced within their projects. We hope to use the insights gained from the event to help improve your research workflow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've kicked off our first GPU Computing group seminar this year with a talk by &lt;strong&gt;Ania Brown&lt;/strong&gt; from Oxford e-Research Centre titled &lt;strong&gt;"Towards achieving GPU-native adaptive mesh refinement"&lt;/strong&gt; on 30th of May 2017. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a method for reducing memory cost by varying the accuracy in each region to match the physical characteristics of the simulation, at the cost of increased data structure complexity. Ania described the optimisation and software challenges that need to be considered when implementing AMR on GPUs, based on her experience working on a GPU-native framework for stencil calculations on a tree-based adaptively refined mesh as part of her Master degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's no offical GPU Computing talks in June but we highly recommend the upcoming talk &lt;strong&gt;"From Democratic Consensus to Cannibalistic Hordes: The Principles of Collective Animal Behaviour"&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Iain Couzin&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;29th of June 2017&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone working on any STEM area knows, as a fact, that we are facing a digital and technical skills gap.  In the governement's digital strategy &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36510266"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; last year it
was highlighted that we would need an extra 745,000 workers with digital skills by 2017, as 90% of jobs require digital skills to some degree.
On top of this, many technical areas suffer a diversity deficit (cultural and gender based).
With the UK being among the European countries with the smaller number of female
professionals in STEM areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being this a rather complex problem, many people and organisations work hard to provide a solution to this issue.  Some approaches adopted by such individuals and organisations are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage the hiring of highly skilled immigrants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide wider support for underrepresented minorities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage inclusive and encouraging environments for those who
demonstrate an interest in STEM areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support and train those willing to make a career change/or follow non-traditonal career paths&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approach the new generations and provide them with useful skills that would help them
make an informed career choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do believe, however, that the most fruitful approach is to work with the upcoming generations and provide them with useful technical and personal skills early on. This would not only make them better qualified for their future but would enable them to make informed decisions with regards to their professional future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk"&gt;Code First: girls&lt;/a&gt; is a multi-award organization that aims to tackle the gender imbalance in three ways: training women, building a strong and supportive community, and helping companies to train, recruit, and retain their female force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belonging to a minority within STEM has lead me to take an active role as an equality and diversity ambassador, which eventually lead me to volunteer as a Python instructor for the Code First courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 8 weeks we teach and guide groups of around 30 women with various levels of coding experience in CSS/HTML, Python, or Ruby. These courses are a mixture of in-person classes and self-learning, at the same time the ladies involved work in teams of 2-4 people to build a project of their own interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="python1" src="http://rse.shef.ac.uk/images/CF_python3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind these workshops is rather simple: train people and provide them with practical use of the skills they are learning. Having as a final objective to develop a fully deployed RESTful app. But the whole CF:girls thing goes way beyond that. Over those 8 weeks the girls form a strong, motivating, and supportive community, in which they can acquire new skills, meet like-minded people, learn from other women working in STEM areas, and even attend external women in tech events!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="python1" src="http://rse.shef.ac.uk/images/CF_python2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find rather interesting the mixture of apps and projects pursued, as well as the high quality of the presented final products. But beyond that, I find this to be an excellent opportunity to give back to the amazing community that has adopted and welcome me as a professional in a STEM area. Thus I can say for sure I will be getting involved in more Code First events/workshops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/sheffield-code-firstgirls/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2017 08:32:49 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coffee and Cakes Event</title><link>http://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/coffee-and-cakes-event-2nd/</link><dc:creator>Mozhgan Kabiri Chimeh</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSE Sheffield is hosting another coffee and cakes event on &lt;strong&gt;May 31st at 14:00 in the Ada Lovelace room&lt;/strong&gt; on 1st floor of the Computer Science Department (Regents Court East).

Well if you use windows as your main OS there are plenty of reasons but the most obvious is that you may be developing cross platform code and want to build and test it without dual booting. If you are thinking about virtual machines then forget about it. Most (except some very expensive enterprise options) do not have the ability to access a GPU device (e.g GPU pass-through) from within a virtual machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this post is to describe how to install the necessary tools to permit local GPU development inside the Linux NSight IDE from within Windows. The advantages of which are not only cross platform development but also the ability to locally develop in powerful Linux IDE with remote execution and graphical debugging. This is particularly helpful if you want to execute or debug your code on a HPC system (like Sheffield's ShARC system) from Windows. The post focuses on the use of the new Windows 10 Linux subsystem, however you could use the approach to install CUDA tools on a lightweight Linux virtual machine. The concept is the same either way. i.e. build and debug locally execute remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuring the Linux Windows Subsystem for CUDA compilation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 10 subsystem for Linux is available in the anniversary update. You can install it from the "Turn on or off windows features" dialogue. It is listed under "Windows subsystem for Linux (beta)". This alone is not enough to build our GPU applications as we will need to install CUDA. A normal CUDA install will require a local GPU and the installation of a CUDA compatible graphics driver. Fire up the Windows Bash Shell (or a Linux virtual machine). You can then use the following commands to install the CUDA toolkit without installing a graphics driver. This will install the core NVIDIA CUDA compiler (nvcc) and NSight. You can update the &lt;code&gt;CUDA_REPO_PKG&lt;/code&gt; variable to install a different CUDA version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;CUDA_REPO_PKG=cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_8.0.44-1_amd64.deb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CUDA_REPO_PKG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;sudo dpkg -i &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;CUDA_REPO_PKG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends cuda-core-8-0 cuda-cudart-dev-8-0 nsight&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can now create a symbolic link to a generic CUDA install. This will permit the addition and fast swapping of different CUDA versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;sudo ln -s /usr/local/cuda-8.0 /usr/local/cuda &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;export PATH=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;:/usr/local/cuda/bin&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Note: if you want the CUDA bin location to be persistently on the PATH (after you reboot the Bash shell) then you will need to add the &lt;code&gt;export PATH&lt;/code&gt; line to your .bashrc profile. Test that the install was successful by running nvcc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nvcc --version
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This should give you some information on the nvcc version. e.g. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nvcc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Cuda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;compiler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;driver&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Copyright&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2016&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;NVIDIA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Corporation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Built&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Tue_Jan_10_13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;03&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_CST_2017&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Cuda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;compilation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;release&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;V8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.61&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The CUDA toolkit is now installed so you can build (but not execute) CUDA GPU programs using the Linux bash shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphical editing with Nsight IDE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be able to run a graphical NSight IDE from within the Windows subsystem for Linux you will need to be running a X server within Windows. You can install the &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/"&gt;XMing&lt;/a&gt; application for this purpose. If you would rather use a Linux virtual machine then you can avoid this step as the virtual machine will most likely have an X server included. The advantage of the Windows subsystem approach is that it is very lightweight. From within your Bash terminal you will need to set the following environment variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;export DISPLAY=:0
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The display variable is an environment variable passed to graphical applications. In this case, the value of &lt;code&gt;:0&lt;/code&gt; it tells the application to use the first display on the local system (our XMing server in this case). If you want to make this environment variable change permanent then you should add it to your .bashrc profile. You can now run the NSight application from Bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;nsight
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Glorious isn't it. Within NSight we can create a new CUDA project which will compile using the local CUDA install. In order to remotely execute and debug you can use the "C++ Remote application" run configuration. This will require SSH access to a suitable Linux machine with a GPU and CUDA installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future blog posts will cover how remote execution and debugging can be achieved on the University of Sheffield ShARC system. ShARC has a typical of job based HPC system which encourages job submission rather than execution of code on worker nodes via SSH logins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary of Bash Profile Changes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added the following to my .bashrc profile (located in the home directory) to ensure that NSight could be launched straight after starting the Bash shell in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt; add cuda bin dir to path&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;export PATH=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;:/usr/local/cuda/bin&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt; export the display environment variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;export DISPLAY=:0&lt;/span&gt;

We are sharing with the rest of the community in case its useful to you &lt;a href="https://github.com/mikecroucher/Intro_to_HPC/blob/gh-pages/README.md"&gt;https://github.com/mikecroucher/Intro_to_HPC/blob/gh-pages/README.md&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its for people whove never used a HPC system before. By the time theyve finished, they are able to submit their own Spark jobs to the HPC cluster.
If anyone is interested in us re-running this as a workshop (it takes around 2 hours) let us know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some notes on our current implementation of Spark on HPC:-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently restricted to jobs that run on one node. This is because Sheffields HPC clusters are not traditional Hadoop/Spark clusters and so some level of integration is required between Sun Grid Engine and Spark. We've only managed to get as far as implementing this across single nodes at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way weve fudged this is to make sure that we provide our students with access to nodes with a LOT of memory  768 GB per node in fact, 12 times as much as you get on a normal node on ShARC or Iceberg. We are experimenting with allowing others access to our kit via a contribution based model. See &lt;a href="http://rse.shef.ac.uk/resources/hpc/premium-hpc"&gt;http://rse.shef.ac.uk/resources/hpc/premium-hpc/&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

I noted that if you're not sure if a Sun Grid Engine (SGE) job can ever run on an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer"&gt;HPC cluster&lt;/a&gt;
you can perform 'dry-run' job validation:
by passing &lt;code&gt;-w v&lt;/code&gt; as arguments to &lt;code&gt;qrsh&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;qrshx&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;qsh&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;qalter&lt;/code&gt; you can ask the SGE scheduler software 
if your job could ever run if the cluster were entirely empty of other jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    qsub -pe smp 2 -l rmem=10000G -w v myjob.sge
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;would most likely tell you that your job could not be run in any of the cluster's job queues 
(due to the size of the resource request).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But beware:&lt;/strong&gt; 
as mentioned in my earlier post 
this his job validation mechanism sometimes results in &lt;em&gt;false negatives&lt;/em&gt; i.e. you are told that a job cannot run even though though in reality it can.&lt;br&gt;
This is something that the HPC sysadmin team at the University of Leeds alerted us to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a false positive (using our &lt;a href="https://docs.hpc.shef.ac.uk/en/latest/sharc/"&gt;ShARC&lt;/a&gt; cluster.&lt;br&gt;
If you ask for a single-core interactive session with access to four GPUs then dry-run validation fails:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    [te1st@sharc-login1 ~]$ qrsh -l gpu=4 -w v
    ...
    verification: no suitable queues
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;yet (without validation) the resource request can be satisfied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    [te1st@sharc-login1 ~]$ qrsh -l gpu=4 
    [te1st@sharc-node100 ~]$   # works!
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;reason for this&lt;/strong&gt; appears to be that the validation is performed 
without running any &lt;a href="http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman1/jsv.html"&gt;Job Submission Verifier&lt;/a&gt; (JSV) scripts.
These scripts are run (typically on the SGE master machine) on every submitted job to 
centrally modify or reject job requests post-submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On ShARC the main JSV script changes a job's &lt;a href="http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net/htmlman/htmlman5/project.html?pathrev=V62u5_TAG"&gt;Project&lt;/a&gt; 
from a generic one 
to &lt;code&gt;gpu&lt;/code&gt; 
if &lt;code&gt;x &amp;gt; 0&lt;/code&gt; GPUs have been requested using &lt;code&gt;-l gpu=x&lt;/code&gt;.
The job can then be assigned to (GPU-equipped) nodes associated with that project.
So, if the JSV is not run before job validation (using &lt;code&gt;-w v&lt;/code&gt;) then 
validation of jobs that request GPUs will fail as 
no nodes (more accurately &lt;em&gt;queue instances&lt;/em&gt;) will be found that can satisfy the resource request 
given the (default) project of jobs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workaround here is to explicitly request a Project (using e.g. &lt;code&gt;-P gpu&lt;/code&gt;) 
when trying to validate a job using &lt;code&gt;-w v&lt;/code&gt; 
i.e. partly duplicate the logic in the (bypassed) JSV,
but this requires that you know have read and understood the JSV.&lt;br&gt;
This is something that users may not want to do and adds complexity, 
when the whole point of investigating job validation in the first place was to 
find a simple way by which users could check if if their jobs could run on a given SGE cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, SGE's job validation mechanism is not a fool-proof option for users as 
it does not take into consideration changes made to a job by Job Submission Verifier scripts post-submission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/sge-job-validation-2/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2017 10:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Introduction to Modern Fortran</title><link>http://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/ModernFortran2017/</link><dc:creator>Mike Croucher</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, the Research Software Engineering group hosted an ‘Introduction to Modern Fortran Course’ taught by EPSRC Research Software Engineering Fellow, &lt;a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=6006"&gt;Ian Bush&lt;/a&gt;.
