The Carpentries foundation is dedicated to teaching researchers the computing skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain. [Software Carpentry][SWC] and [Data Carpentry][DC] workshops ("bootcamps") are hands-on, two-day events that cover the core skills needed to be productive in a small research team. Short tutorials alternate with practical exercises, and all instruction is done via live coding. 

The University of Sheffield is a silver member organisation of the [The Carpentries][]. As such we have a number of qualified software carpentry instructors with the ability to train a number of new instructors each year. Carpentry events and instructor training are jointly organised by a working group formed of members of RSE Sheffield, the Bio-informatics core, the University Library and CiCS.

### Becoming an Instructor

If you are interested in becoming an instructor then you must first volunteer to help with an existing carpentry event. We can offer to pay you for your time by buying out time on your contract for days spend delivering training. The University of Sheffield Software Carpentry working group will prioritise up to six people per year to become instructors.
